The _evReact_ library is an event based control flow management library for supporting this type of programming.\r\n\r\nUsing few compositional operators it is possible to define an event-tracking system that allows to fire handlers only when a particular sequence of events is detected.\r\n\r\n# Where\r\n\r\nThe _evReact_ library is primarily developed in F# and is available to .NET languages. We are adding ports to other programming systems the programming model. The Typescript/Javascript implementation is already available. Python and Java implementations are under development.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
